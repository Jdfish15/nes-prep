           // DOMAIN I: NATURE OF SCIENCE (75 QUESTIONS)
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "A scientist is investigating the effect of different fertilizers on the growth rate of corn. Which of the following should be kept constant?",
    options: ["The type of fertilizer", "The height of the corn plants", "The amount of water each plant receives", "The growth rate"],
    correct: 2,
    reason: "Controlled variables (constants) like water and sunlight must remain the same to ensure the results are due only to the fertilizer."
},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "Which of the following is an example of a qualitative observation?",
    options: ["The liquid has a volume of 25 mL", "The reaction took 45 seconds", "The substance turned a bright blue color", "The temperature increased by 10 degrees"],
    correct: 2,
    reason: "Qualitative observations describe qualities (color, texture) rather than numerical measurements (quantities)."
},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "Which of these is the most appropriate unit for measuring the mass of a paperclip?",
    options: ["Milligrams", "Grams", "Kilograms", "Metric tons"],
    correct: 1,

},

{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "When measuring the volume of water in a graduated cylinder, where should the measurement be read?",
    options: ["The top of the liquid", "The bottom of the meniscus", "The average of the high and low points", "The side closest to the observer"],
    correct: 1,
    reason: "Adhesion causes water to curve; the bottom of that curve (the meniscus) provides the accurate volume."
},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "Which historical figure's work with the 'S-shaped' flask disproved the theory of spontaneous generation?",
    options: ["Charles Darwin", "Louis Pasteur", "Robert Hooke", "Gregor Mendel"],
    correct: 1,

},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "Which of the following describes the 'Law of Parsimony' (Occam's Razor)?",
    options: ["The most complex explanation is usually correct", "The simplest explanation that fits the data is preferred", "Science must be expensive to be valid", "All data points must be used even if they are outliers"],
    correct: 1,
    reason: "Occam's Razor suggests that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected."
},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "What is the primary difference between a scientific law and a scientific theory?",
    options: ["A law is a theory that has been proven", "A law describes a pattern; a theory explains why it happens", "A theory is an unproven law", "Laws only apply to physics; theories apply to biology"],
    correct: 1,
    reason: "Laws describe consistent natural relationships (e.g., Gravity), while theories provide the explanatory framework (e.g., General Relativity)."
},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "A student is heating a test tube over a Bunsen burner. In which direction should the open end of the test tube be pointed?",
    options: ["Toward the student", "Toward the floor", "Away from the student and others", "Straight up at the ceiling"],
    correct: 2,
    reason: "Safety protocols require pointing test tubes away from people to prevent injury from splashing or 'bumping' of the liquid."

    reason: "Primary sources are original reports of research written by the scientists who performed the work."
},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "What does a high 'p-value' (e.g., p > 0.05) typically indicate in an experiment?",
    options: ["The results are highly significant", "The results are likely due to chance", "The experiment was successful", "The sample size was too large"],
    correct: 1,
    reason: "A high p-value suggests that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and the results may be random noise."
},
{
    domain: "I. Nature of Science",
    q: "Which scientist contributed to the discovery of the structure of DNA through X-ray diffraction images?",
    options: ["James Watson", "Francis Crick", "Rosalind Franklin", "Linus Pauling"],
